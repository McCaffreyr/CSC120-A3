Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I talked with Kylie (section 2) and Lydia (section 1). It was helpful to hear I wasn't the only one who doesn't love java. Talking with Lydia reminded me the importance of taking breaks. Talking with Kylie reminded me to start small and go step-by-step. 
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended the 7-9pm Monday TA hours on the 17th. There, a TA helped me figure out how to use Scanners. They suggested I have a second one to solve the problems that came up when I just had one.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I don't love it. I think I'll appreciate it more when I feel more confident with it. For now, I feel like I am googling the proper syntax for so many simple things.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I notice that Python goes line-by-line vs Java running the entire code together because the error messages in Python are much more clear.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would recommend closely reading the README file and then writing a complete version of peudo code first.
